# A student's template.
# To make your module function with the pipeline:
# 0) copy the whole example folder, and replace XX with your initials
# 1) edit the name of the student's function in spatialAggregation.py (around line 58)
# 2) edit the student function that's imported at the top of spatialAggregation.py
# 	(where it now says "import student_XX_spatialAggregation")
# 3) change the string content of <studentFolder> in the 'process_Template' (NB: you can make a copy of process_Template and call it process_StudentXX)

## Here, you can clarify which functions exist in this module.
if __name__ == '__main__': 

	# -- rawDict  -- 
	# A panda that contains the raw data with the keys:
	# - 'Ts' for the time in seconds
	# - 'X' for the x position in meters
	# - 'Y' for the y position in meters
	# - 'PlayerID' for the identifier of a player. *
	# - 'TeamID' for the string that identifies a team.

	# * Note that the 'ball' and 'groupRow' don't refer to a player, 
	# but to a row corresponding to the ball and a row with grouped 
	# information only (e.g., Team A, defenders, all players)

	# -- attributeDict --
	# A panda that contains all the features that are based on the positional data.

	# -- attributeLabel -- 
	# A dictionary that has the same keys as attributeDict. The contents
	# of each key provide a label for each of the computed features,
	# for example: 'Distance to the goal (m)'.
	# When you compute a new feature, please add a corresponding label
	# to the attributeLabel dictionary. Include unit of measurment.

	# -- TeamAstring
	# The string input that corresponds to the team that plays at home.
	# This string is used in rawDict['TeamID'] to indicate the team that
	# a player belongs to.

	# -- TeamBstring
	# The string input that corresponds to the team that plays away.
	# This string is used in rawDict['TeamID'] to indicate the team that
	# a player belongs to.

	# The process function is called to process all subfunctions
	process(rawDict,attributeDict,attributeLabel,TeamAstring,TeamBstring)

	# This is an example that can be used to see how you compute a group level variable.
	teamCentroid_panda(rawDict,attributeDict,attributeLabel,TeamAstring,TeamBstring)
	# This is an example that can be used to see how to compute an individual level variable.
	distanceToCentroid(rawDict,attributeDict,attributeLabel,TeamAstring,TeamBstring)

## Here, you specifiy what each function does
def process(rawDict,attributeDict,attributeLabel,TeamAstring,TeamBstring):
	# Use this is an example for a GROUP level aggregate
	attributeDict_EXAMPLE,attributeLabel_EXAMPLE = \
	teamCentroid_panda(rawDict,attributeDict,attributeLabel,TeamAstring,TeamBstring)

	# Use this is an example for a PLAYER level aggregate
	attributeDict_EXAMPLE,attributeLabel_EXAMPLE = \
	distanceToCentroid(rawDict,attributeDict,attributeLabel,TeamAstring,TeamBstring)

	# NB: Centroid and distance to centroid are stored in example variables that are not exported
	# when 'process' is finished, because these features are already embedded in the main pipeline.
	# Make sure that the name of the output variables that you create corresponds to the variables
	# that this function returns (i.e., 'attributeDict' and 'attributeLabel').

	return attributeDict,attributeLabel
## Of course, you can also create new modules (seperate files), to avoid having a very long file.
## If you do, don't forget to import the module at the top of this file using <import newModule>.
